# _com.castsoftware.labs.mips-redux_ Description

This extension provides computation of the following new assessment indicator\(s\)

* the _MIPS Reduction index_
* supporting Technical Criteria

## Problem Statement

...
MIPS can be saved by making Software more efficient

## Research Labs proposal

To identify pieces of Software that could be optimized to withstand unexpected workload, increased "scrutiny" from hackers, "seamless" evolution of execution environment, the Research Labs offer a solution based on CAST AIP Assessment Model.

* The _MIPS Reduction Index_ is a Business Criterion that aggregates impactful mainframe Quality Rules from Efficiency- and Robustness-related Technical Criteria
* grouped into new dedicated Technical Criteria

The Research Labs released this first version of the MIPS Reduction Index to leverage the expertise and experience of customers in order to fine-tune its exact composition and collect feedback.

## Formula

The MIPS Reduction Index is based on the following Technical Criteria

* MIPS Reduction - focus on data access efficiency
* MIPS Reduction - focus on algorithmic costs
* MIPS Reduction - focus on avoiding transaction failure

The Technical Criteria have been populated with Quality Rules with aggregate weight greater or equal to 5 of the following existing Technical Criteria:

* Efficiency - Expensive Calls in Loops
* Efficiency - SQL and Data Handling Performance
* Programming Practices - Error and Exception Handling
* Programming Practices - Unexpected Behavior

# In what situation should you install this extension?

If you are interested in getting a preview of what the MIPS Reduction index would be and are willing to share the results to help the CAST Research Labs validate them.

# Release notes

N\/A

# _com.castsoftware.labs.mips-redux_ technology support

Mainframe technology only is supported \(by design\).

# Function Point, Quality and Sizing support

This extension is designed to bring new quality indicator aside existing ones.

# CAST AIP compatibility

This extension is compatible with:

* 8.1.x out-of-the-box \(AIP release used for the tests\)
* 8.0.x after changing the nuspec file \(there is no reason the extension would not work but it was not tested\)
* 7.x.x after changing the nuspec file \(there is no reason the extension would not work but it was not tested\)

# Supported DBMS servers

This extension is currently supported on CAST databases installed on any supported RDBMS.

# Prerequisites

* An installation of any compatible release of CAST AIP \(see table above\)

# Bug Fix List

N\/A

# Download and installation instructions

Please see:  [Extension Link Installation](http://doc.castsoftware.com/display/DOCEXT/Extension+download+and+installation)

The installation steps are the following:

* download the extension through the CAST Extension Downloader using the https://extend.castsoftware.com:443/labs download server
* open Server Manager 8.1+
* select the existing set of databases to update \/ install a new set of databases
* manage extensions of the existing set of database \/ follow the installation wizard up to the manage extension pane
* download _com.castsoftware.labs.mips-redux
* run the update \/ the installation  
* open CAST Management Studio
* import the Assessment Model from the Dashboard Service processed in steps \#3 to \#6 above; this is a _Mandatory_ step to start computing the new indicator, one MUST import and use the Assessment Model from the Dashboard that was updated with the extension

# Packaging, delivering and analyzing your source code

Packaging, delivering and analyzing your source code is performed the same way as usual.

To get results:

* run a new snapshot \(if not possible, contact the Research Labs for alternative procedure\)

To avoid computing the MIPS Reduction index for applications that are not candidate to MIPS reduction:

* open CAST Management Studio
* edit the Dashboard Service\(s\) you are publishing the Snapshots of the N\/A application\(s\)
* select the Assessment Model tab
* create an exclusion for the MIPS Reduction index and the N\/A application\(s\)
